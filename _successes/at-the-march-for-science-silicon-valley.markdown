Some of us marched here in San Jose, while many others marched around the world.  The March for Science Silicon Valley started at 11 a.m. at San Jose City Hall and culminated in a rally at Silicon Valley Comic Conâ€™s free outdoor festival at Plaza de Cesar Chavez starting at noon. The family-friendly festival and rally included science-focused educational activities and opportunities for nonpartisan advocacy for evidence-based policy. Experts in climate change, coding, astrophysics, STEAM education, local politicians, celebrities and more spoke.
