call-script-text: "OPTION 1: IF YOUR REPRESENTATIVE VOTED FOR TRUMPCARE\n\nCaller:
  Good morning/afternoon! I’m calling to express my disappointment and anger that
  Rep. ______ voted for TumpCare. I’d like to know why Rep. ___ would vote to take
  away coverage from 24 million Americans. Can he justify his vote?\n\nStaffer: Thank
  you for calling. Rep. ______ voted for the American Health Care Act because Obamacare
  was collapsing and this bill will fix it.\n\nCaller: That is wrong. The ACA isn’t
  perfect, but it has expanded access to coverage to millions of Americans. It created
  protections that ensure that people with pre-existing conditions wouldn’t be denied
  access to health care, or be forced to pay higher premiums. Instead of working to
  make health care better for Americans, Rep. ____ has put millions of American lives
  at risk. This is unacceptable.\n\nStaffer: Actually, the American Health Care Act
  contained provisions that ensure that people with pre-existing conditions aren’t
  charged more for their health care. More than $130 billion is allocated to protect
  American consumers.\n\nCaller: That is a lie. You promised me that you wouldn’t
  vote on a bill that eliminated protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
  TrumpCare creates a giant loophole for insurance companies to charge people with
  pre-existing more for their health care. As someone [with/who knows someone with]
  a [pre-existing condition], I’m angry that you would betray your word in order to
  give Donald Trump a political win.\n\nIf Rep. ____ gets another chance to vote on
  TrumpCare, I demand that he vote no. I also want him to justify his vote to his
  constituents by holding a town hall this recess.\n\nStaffer: Thank you, I will pass
  along your concern.\n\nCaller: Please do, and take down my contact info, I would
  like a written explanation for his vote.\n\nOPTION 2: IF YOUR REPRESENTATIVE VOTED
  AGAINST TRUMPCARE [ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE REPUBLICAN]\n\nCaller: Good morning/afternoon!
  I’m calling to say thank you to Rep. ______ for voting against TumpCare. I know
  that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan were pressuring him/her to vote in favor, and so
  I appreciate her/him standing up for her/his constituents.\n\n[Republican] Staffer:
  Thank you for calling. Rep. ______ voted against the American Health Care Act because
  even though she/he doesn’t support Obamacare, she/he just could not vote to eliminate
  protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nCaller: I would like to
  thank her/him for her/his courage. Going against your party for the wellbeing of
  constituents is what every member should do. There is a good chance that this bill
  returns after getting changed in the Senate. Will Rep. ____ commit to me, her/his
  constituent that she/he will vote against this bill if it comes back to the House?\n\nStaffer:
  We don’t know what the bill will look like if it gets out of the Senate. Once we
  have legislative language, Rep. ____ will review before taking a position. But I
  will certainly pass along your thoughts and concerns.\n\nCaller: Please do, and
  take down my contact info. I would like to hear more from Rep. _____ as the bill
  moves along.\n\n \n\n--OR--\n\n SAMPLE CALL DIALOGUE (from www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/gop-health-care-repeal-hold-accountable/):\n\n[Democratic]
  Staffer: Thank you for calling. Rep. ______ voted against the American Health Care
  Act because she/he wants to make sure that every American has access to affordable
  health care. TrumpCare would take it away from 24 million people, which is completely
  unacceptable. She/he will continue to fight against it should it come back for another
  vote in the House.\nCaller: Thank you. There is a good chance that this bill returns
  after getting changed in the Senate. Will Rep. ____ commit to me, her/his constituent
  that she/he will vote against this bill if it comes back to the House?\n\nStaffer:
  Yes, Rep. ______ supports the ACA and will continue to fight to protect it.\n\nCaller:
  Thank you."

From The Indivisiblog (www.indivisibleguide.com/blog/):

May 4, 2017 was a day of infamy in the House of Representatives—and, no doubt, will long be remembered. On that day, Republicans eked out a narrow House floor passage of the GOP health bill. The vote occurred even though few read the bill, and it was rushed through before a non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis could be prepared.

We do know, however, that the bill would cause tens of millions to lose health insurance. It also would make coverage unaffordable for people most in need of care—especially those with pre-existing health conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems. And it would take away over $800 billion in health care funds intended for the poor, transferring most of them to tax give-aways for the wealthy and special interest groups.

The harmful votes cast that day, and the galling Rose Garden celebration President Trump held with House Republicans immediately thereafter, must not, and will not, be forgotten or forgiven during the next two election cycles.

To ensure that result, grassroots activists across the country launched a campaign to hold House Republicans accountable. The “Payback Project”—spearheaded by Indivisible, MoveOn, Town Hall Project, and Women’s March—is making sure House members can’t hide from this vote or from their constituents. Voters will repeatedly be reminded how their representative jeopardized their families’ health care and lives, promoting electoral repercussions that will be intense.

The bill already is opposed by larger margins than the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ever was!

As these important accountability efforts move forward, it will be no less crucial for activists to focus on round two of the legislative process: Senate consideration of the health bill. Since Republicans only have a bare Senate majority, this is where our active opposition has its greatest prospects for success. We must focus like a laser beam on the biggest stakes of that debate, of which at least five concerns will arise that deserve highest-priority advocacy.
