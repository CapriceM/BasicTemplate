call-script-text: "Caller: Good morning/afternoon! Can you let me know Rep. ______’s
  position on the American Health Care Act and the MacArthur Amendment?\n\nOption
  1: If your Rep. opposes the AHCA\n\nStaffer: Thank you for calling. Rep. ______
  opposes this legislation.\n\nCaller: That’s great! Please tell Rep. ____ thank you
  for opposing the bill. I’d like to hear him/her speak out in the media or on the
  House floor against repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She/he needs to make it clear
  that she/he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions, those on Medicaid,
  and everyone else who depends on the Affordable Care Act for their health and wellbeing.
  \n\nStaffer: I will certainly pass on your message to Rep. ______.\n\nCaller: Please
  do. This is extremely important to me and I will be watching closely for her/his
  public statements in opposition. Thank you for your time.\n\nOption 2: If your Rep.
  supports the AHCA\n\nStaffer: Thank you for calling. Rep. _____ supports AHCA and
  the MacArthur Amendment.\n\nCaller: I’m very disappointed to hear that. This bill
  would take away health care from millions of Americans, would cut the Medicaid program,
  and give $600 billion in tax breaks to the wealthy. The MacArthur amendment only
  makes the bill worse – it would allow states to get rid of protections for people
  with pre-existing conditions. This is unacceptable to me.\n\n[I/my family member]
  am at risk of losing [my/his/her] insurance. [I/ my family member] have a pre-existing
  condition that before the ACA could be used by insurance companies to discriminate
  against me. My health depends on Rep. ____ voting against the American Health Care
  Act.\n\nStaffer: I will certainly pass on your concerns to Rep. _________\n\nCaller:
  Please do. This is extremely important to me and I will be watching closely. Thank
  you for your time.\n\nOption 3: If your Rep. dodges or has no opinion on AHCA\n\nStaffer:
  Thank you for calling! I’m not sure if Rep. _____ supports or opposes the American
  Health Care Act at this time, but I’m happy to take down your concerns.\n\nCaller:
  I’m disappointed to hear that and would ask Rep. ______ to oppose this bill.\n\nHere
  are my concerns. This bill would leave millions more uninsured, undermine critical
  protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and cut Medicaid for the most
  vulnerable.\n\n[I/my family member] am at risk of losing [my/his/her] insurance.
  [I/ my family member] have a pre-existing condition that before the ACA could be
  used by insurance companies to discriminate against me. My health depends on Rep.
  ____ voting against the American Health Care Act.\n\nI expect Rep. _______ to publicly
  state his/her opposition to this destructive bill and prioritize the health and
  wellbeing of his/her constituents.\n\nStaffer: I will certainly pass on your concerns
  to Rep. ______.\n\nCaller: Please do, and please take down my contact information
  to let me know when Rep. ______ has made up his/her mind. I’m eager to hear what
  he/she decides."

The House of Representatives has not given up on its efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Their bill (American Health Care Act, or AHCA) will strip coverage from at least 24 million people and gut Medicaid in order to give $600 billion in tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations.

[More about why the bill will harm health care consumers]

With the latest addition of the MacArthur amendment, the bill is now even worse, undermining critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions. If this bill passes, millions will lose their access to coverage and care, costs will go up, and the stability of the health care system will be in jeopardy.

Call your members of Congress and urge them to reject the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Call or visit your members to let them know where you stand.
