Congress needs to pass a new funding bill before the April 28th deadline, or the government will shut down. Donald Trump is trying to pressure Congress into gutting critical programs and funding his top priorities. It’s up to you to push back.

At the end of April, funding for the government expires. This means that Congress needs to pass a new funding bill before the April 28th deadline, or the government will shut down. If the government shuts down, key federal offices that millions of Americans rely on, like the Depts. of Education, Energy, Interior, Homeland Security, and many others, will almost entirely shut down. There are a few options on the table for how Congress might pass a funding bill—but the bottom line is that it has to pass something.

What that funding bill will contain is still being negotiated by Congress, but if Donald Trump’s budget request is any indication of what it might contain, we should all be very worried.
