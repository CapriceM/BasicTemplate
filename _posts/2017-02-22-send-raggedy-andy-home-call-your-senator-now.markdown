Congress has the power to create a special commission to conduct an investigation that is truly independent, bipartisan, and unbiased. It should do so immediately.

It seems like nearly every day, there is a new revelation of connections between Trumpâ€™s associates and the Russian government and of possible interference in the 2016 general election.  At the same time, Republican members of Congress (MoCs) investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election have conducted themselves in partisan and inappropriate manners.

Congress owes the American people the full story of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Here's what to ask your Democratic Members of Congress during recess: "Will you promise to keep fighting for the American people by continuing to speak openly about the need for an independent inquiry into Russian interference?"
