The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

We’re teaming up with Silicon Valley Comic Con to bring you our family-friendly rally at their free outdoor festival! Our march will start at San Jose City Hall at 11 AM and lead to a rally at Plaza de Cesar Chavez at noon. We’re partnering to bring you tons of educational science activities and... a great time!

11 am: March starts at San Jose City Hall
Noon: Rally at Plaza de Cesar Chavez with free Silicon Valley Comic Con festival
