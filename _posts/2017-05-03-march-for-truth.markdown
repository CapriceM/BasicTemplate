Join the national #MarchForTruth and demand the Truth about Trump/Russia!  Marches are currently being planned in DC, LA and NY. Watch this space for more updates! 

We've all heard the saying "the truth shall set you free". At no time in recent human history has this phrase had more relevance.

While oceans rise, storms rage and our water and air are polluted, a bunch of greedy climate change deniers led by Donald Trump are engaged in what might be the biggest cash grab ever. One that will come at the greatest cost. Of course, no cost to them personally though. It is you and I that will pay for this. It's our children and grandchildren who will pay for it. Our very home is threatened by greed. There is no planet B.

We the people demand our government to accept the findings of science. Because science is the TRUTH. 

President 45 and his corrupt regime are currently working on what they're calling "tax reform". Meanwhile, the President has never divested from his businesses and still refuses to show his tax returns. How will the proposed "tax reform" help 45 and his billionaire buddies? We demand the TRUTH about our president's gross misconduct in profiting from the presidency.

Did the Trump campaign collude with Russia in their attack on our electoral process? Is Trump guilty of treason? They vetted Mike Flynn, they knew what he was up to. They still thought he was the best choice for our National Security advisor. We demand to know the TRUTH about our election. We demand an independent commission to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Whatever your thoughts are on this issue, it is in everyone's best interest to put that whole mess behind us so that we can move forward as a nation.

Scott Pruitt sued the EPA dozens of times before becoming the head of the agency. He was put there to dismantle the very organization he is in charge of. Rex Tillerson was the CEO of FREAKING EXXON. He now represents our country in all foreign affairs. This entire administration a cash grab plain and simple. Jeff Sessions is a known racist with a horrible human rights record. Steve Bannon is a known white nationalist, which is just a rebranding for white supremacist. WE demand the TRUTH from MEDIA. Call these racist money hungry scum out for what they are.

None of this is subtle. None of this is normal. We demand the TRUTH.

We don't need to impeach Donald Trump. We need to uproot his entire regime. We need to replace the filthy pig politicians, Republican and Democrat, that live in the pockets of the oil and coal industries. The people need to take back this country. 

The TRUTH of the matter is that we don't need resistance. That time has past. We need REVOLUTION.

It's not the truth that will set you free. It's you.
