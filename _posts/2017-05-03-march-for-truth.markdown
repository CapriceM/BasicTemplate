JOIN DEMONSTRATORS ALL OVER THE US TO CALL FOR AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE US ELECTION AND TIES TO DONALD TRUMP, HIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS ASSOCIATES!

***A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR MUST BE NAMED, AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ESTABLISHED AND CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD BE PROPERLY RESOURCED AND PURSUED FREE OF PARTISAN INTERESTS;

***CONGRESS MUST COMPEL DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS TO CLARIFY ANY FOREIGN OBLIGATIONS

***THE PUBLIC DESERVES TRANSPARENCY AND A NONPARTISAN PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH

Washington, DC- On the back of the bombshell news that Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, a coalition of grassroots, local organizers across the country have joined together under the banner of “#MarchForTruth,” calling for urgency and transparency in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Donald Trump and his associates. Demonstrations have been organized in 70+ cities, with more joining each day.

Alarmed at multiple reports that the House and Senate investigations are under-resourced, crippled by partisanship, and may not be complete for many months, the #MarchForTruth demands that lawmakers and agencies properly execute these inquiries to the satisfaction of the American people. The will of the people is clear- 78% of Americans want an independent investigation.

There is more than sufficient cause for alarm about the role Russian state-led hacking and information warfare played in the 2016 election, and there are crucial unanswered questions about the relationship between the Russian state and Donald Trump, his associates and his campaign. The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.

Across the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd. The goals are simple:

A special prosecutor must be named, an independent commission must be established, and Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests;

As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;

Congress should require Donald Trump to release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;

If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.

The firing of FBI Director Comey, Senate testimony from Sally Yates and James Clapper, and revelations about the Trump administration’s handling of information that Mike Flynn was compromised further underscore the need for urgent, well-resourced investigations. As Senator Richard Blumenthal noted this week, “people want the truth uncovered about how the Russians sought to interfere and undermine our democracy and electoral system. And they also want accountability.”

Participating cities are joining daily. A selection of currently planning demonstrations include Anchorage, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Brandon FL, Charleston SC, Charlotte NC, Chicago, Cincinnati, Columbus OH, Eugene, Grand Rapids, Hickory NC, Helena Montana, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Madison, Montpelier, Myrtle Beach, New York, Miami, Milwaukee, Melbourne, Omaha, Palm Beach, Pensacola, Portland OR, Raleigh, Rapid City, Reno, Richmond Virginia, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, Sarasota, Seattle, St. Joseph MI, St. Louis, St. Petersburg FL, Syracuse, Tri-Cities Washington, and Washington DC. More join each day.

National Partner organizations include Indivisible, Free Speech for People, Town Hall Project, The Opposition, Our States and PDA. Organizing partners include Wisconsin Progressives Alliance, Indivisible St. Louis, Indivisible San Bernardino, We March Party, Indivisible Charleston, Indivisible Chicago, United We Stand, Indivisible Eugene, Resist616, March on Montana, Indivisible Las Vegas, Indivisible Omaha, United Against Trump Pence, Pop Up Protest South Florida, Indivisible RI, Carson City Working Families Party, Northern Nevada Marches Forward, Indivisible Northern Nevada, Action Together Nevada, Get Involved Nevada, Indivisible Richmond, Persisterhood of Saint Joseph, CNY Solidarity, Indivisible SF and many others.

QUOTES FROM PARTNERS:

"Across the country, constituents have flooded town halls to let their representatives know that they want impartial investigations into Russian interference in our elections," said Jimmy Dahman, executive director of Town Hall Project. "Transparency is critical to the democratic process, and we are proud to partner with the #MarchForTruth in holding Congress accountable to the people that elected them."

“The allegations that President Trump or members of his team may have coordinated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election are the most explosive charges in American political history,” said Ron Fein, Legal Director of Free Speech For People. “The American people deserve and demand a credible independent investigation.”

"The American people deserve nothing less than an immediate, impartial, and complete investigation into Russia's interference in our election and any ties between the Kremlin and Trump or his associates," said Leah Greenberg, Chief Strategy Officer of Indivisible Project. "Indivisible groups across the country are proud to join the #MarchForTruth and demand that their members of Congress do the right thing. The integrity of our democracy depends on it."

"It's clear that Michael Flynn, who was compromised by the Russians, would still be in the White House if it weren't for leaks, yet that's all that the GOP seems to want to focus on in the #RussiaGate hearings,” said Andrea Chalupa, author, activist and #MarchForTruth organizer. “What more is this administration hiding? With our nation's sovereignty at stake, it's time for Republican leaders to put country before party just like they did during the Watergate scandal."

"If we learned anything from Sally Yates' testimony, it's that this administration has ignored attempts by loyal public servants to bring transparency. We must have full transparency throughout this investigation," said Jordan Uhl, Executive Director of the The Opposition (oppstn.com[oppstn.com]). "We're supporting this nationwide, grassroots movement because we believe the American people want an honest, independent inquiry and, ultimately, answers."

"Since the inauguration of President Trump, The Russian hacking of our election and potential subsequent collusion with members of the Presidential campaign has cast a pall over the entirety of the administration,” said Josef Preston, Indivisible Charleston Legislative Coordinator. “It is only natural that the people want to get to the bottom of this matter, so American democracy can be reestablished as a shining beacon of light around the world. The world and the people need closure."

"This isn't about party. This is about rule of law, and potentially egregious conflicts of interest within the Executive Branch," said Donna Smith, Executive Director of Progressive Democrats Of America. "Congress must do its job legitimately, and invest serious resources into a bipartisan investigation into Russian ties with the White House, and those within the administration's direct sphere of influence. If it can't happen within Congress, then a special prosecutor must be named, and we must get to the truth, one way or the other, in a transparent and public way."

"The Trump Administration began under a cloud of deception, winning an election tainted by foreign influence. In Chicago, we will stand indivisible in the fight for Truth." said Jason Rieger, founder Indivisible Chicago. "We will rally downtown and march to Trump Tower to push back against the endless barrage of lies emanating from the White House."
