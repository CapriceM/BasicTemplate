Today, Trump tweeted: "FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony..."

Tomorrow, FBI Director James Comey will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in a hearing on FBI oversight.  Watch it live starting around 7 am Pacific Time at this link: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/watch-live-fbi-director-comey-testify-senate-judiciary-committee/.  (You can bet that Trump will be watching...!)

On Thursday, Comey is to speak behind closed doors to the House committee looking into the Russia issues.  And on Monday, May 8, former acting attorney general Sally Yates is scheduled to appear at a congressional hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Watch this space!
