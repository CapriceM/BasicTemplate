This Wednesday, Trump removed the man often called "the real President" from the National Security Council.  There are growing rumors that Bannon may soon be out altogether, either at Trump's request or of his own volition.  Either way, can't happen soon enough for us.  But removal from the Security Council alone is cause enough for celebration!
