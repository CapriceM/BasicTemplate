The theme for this week's in-person meetup is "We're Connecting!" 
Indivisible is all about community, as well as resistance, so group members have been out there exploring and working with other local resistance groups. They'll be sharing their insights and impressions with us - kind of an assortment of Yelp reviews of poltical action groups! 

Please join us for this fun and informative meeting, and find out how you can help the resistance! We'll have a sign-up table and volunteers to help connect you to people and activities that interest you. There's a lot going on in our area!

If this is your first Indiviible meeting, we encourage you to read the Indivisible Guide before the meeting - it provides great information, context and inspiration! Here's a link to the Indivisible Guide: https://www.indivisibleguide.com/
